RESOURCES

This tarball contains the EVALITA 2009 Resources for the PoS Tagging
task.

1 - The file "train" contains the Train Corpus annotated using the Tanl
tagset [1] and must be used for training participating systems.
It consists in 108,875 word forms divided into 3,719 sentences.

2 - The file "devel" contains the Development Corpus, a smaller corpus
annotated according to Tanl tagset, to be used for development.
It consists in 5,014 word forms divided into 149 sentences.

The Tanl tagset includes morphological features and consists of 328
tags, from 14 basic categories. Documentation can be found at
http://medialab.di.unipi.it/wiki/Tanl_POS_Tagset.

The training data set consists of articles from the online edition of
the newspaper La Repubblica (http://www.repubblica.it/).  These data
have been annotated in several steps: the first step was performed by
the group of Andrea Baroni at the Universita' di Bologna and consisted
in manually assigning a set of coarse-grain POS tags; then the
MorphIt! [2] automated tool was used to assign a list of possible
morphological tags to each token; a conversion script incorporating
some heuristics was used to convert the POS and morphological tags
into the Tanl tagset. A final manual revision was applied to the whole
corpus followed by a complete automated cross-check with an Italian
lexicon of over 1,25 million forms.

The data to be used in development are estracted form the Italian
Wikipedia, automatically tagged and manually revised.

DATA FORMAT

Data adheres to the following rules:
    * Data files contain sentences separated by a blank line.
    * A sentence consists of one or more tokens, each one 
      starting on a new line.
    * A token consists of two fields described in the table below.
      Fields are separated by one tab character.
    * Data files are are UTF-8 encoded (unicode).

Data format:

Field 1: FORM 		Word form or punctuation symbol
Field 2: POSTAG 	Fine-grained part-of-speech tag, with
			morphology, based on the TANL tagset.

Example:

A	E
ben	B
pensarci	Vfc
,	FF
l'	RDns
intervista	Sfs
dell'	EAns
on.	SA
Formica	SP
e'	VAip3s
stata	VApsfs
accolta	Vpsfs
in	E
genere	Sms
con	E
disinteresse	Sms
.	FS

The example illustrates some tokenization issues:
    * abbreviations are properly identified as tokens (on.);
    * apostrophes representing a truncation are kept with the
      truncated token (l'intervista);
    * possible multi-word expressions (MWE) are not combined 
      into a single token (in_genere);
    * clitics are not separated from the token (pensarci).
